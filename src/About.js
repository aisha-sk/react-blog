          <p style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }}>In this project, I've built a React-based web application that showcases the implementation of several concepts and tools.
           I used the React library to create reusable and interactive components, 
           allowing me to manage the user interface efficiently. 
           
           To fetch and manipulate data, I employed the Fetch API and Axios for making HTTP requests 
           to a JSON Server, which simulates a backend API. 
           
           Additionally, React Router helped me handle navigation and routing within the application,
            enabling multiple pages and URL parameter handling. 
            Moreover, I utilized Flexbox for responsive and flexible component layout. 
            
            Throughout the project, I leveraged custom hooks to extract shared logic and promote 
            code modularity and reusability.</p>
